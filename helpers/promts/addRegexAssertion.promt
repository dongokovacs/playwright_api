Let's keep only the test // Verify slug contains sanitized title.

Here are business requirement about title and slug format to consider in the regex validation: 
title text and slug text should be the same, except words in the slug should be spearated by "-" 
and the end of the slug should be uppended with any number.

Examples:
Title: "Discover Bondar Academy: Your Gateway to Efficient Learning"
Slug: "Discover-Bondar-Academy:-Your-Gateway-to-Efficient-Learning-1"
